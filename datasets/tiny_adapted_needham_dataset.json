        "content": "You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city} population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Using search_agent MUST be the first step of your plan.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['json', 'random', 'itertools', 'PIL', 'bs4', 'math', 'numpy', 'requests', 'pandas', 'xml', 'PyPDF2', 'stat', 'fractions', 'unicodedata', 'yahoo_finance', 'zipfile', 'chess', 'collections', 'statistics', 'Bio', 'scipy', 'pptx', 'io', 'pydub', 'csv', 'sklearn', 'torch', 'time', 'pubchempy', 'queue', 're', 'sympy', 'datetime', 'os']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000."

Task outcome (short version):\nThe 2018 VSCode blog post on replit.com appears to be “Zero Setup VSCode Intelligence” published on July 1, 2018. Based on a thorough read, there is no mention of any last video nor any command to remove extra lines.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nWe located a 2018 blog post on the Replit blog titled “Zero Setup VSCode Intelligence,” dated July 1, 2018 (https://blog.replit.com/intel). It discusses Microsoft’s Language Server Protocol (LSP), Monaco (the editor powering VS Code), and new features such as Autocomplete, Jump to Definition, Find References, Refactoring, Linting, Hover tips, and Formatting. We thoroughly examined the entire post (including text and images) and found no references to a “last video.” Additionally, there is no mention of a command specifically for removing extra lines. The article focuses on how Replit integrated the VSCode technology and LSP to handle multiple programming languages, with no mention of a video or a line-removal command.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nNo alternative 2018 VSCode blog post was located on the Replit blog, and no instructions on removing extra lines were discovered.

And soon we&#x27;ll be adding support for more languages -- Java and Ruby are looking to be next in line.\\n\\nLet&#x27;s run through some of the features:\\n\\nAutocomplete and signatures\"/><meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://blog.replit.com/cover.png\"/><meta property=\"og:t\n..._This content has been truncated to stay below 20000 characters_...\ndecoding=\"async\" data-nimg=\"1\" class=\"w-full rounded-8 border border-outlineDimmest mb-0\" style=\"color:transparent;background-size:cover;background-position:50% 50%;background-repeat:no-repeat;background-image:url(&quot;data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns=&#x27;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#x27; viewBox=&#x27;0 0 1000 769&#x27;%3E%3Cfilter id=&#x27;b&#x27; color-interpolation-filters=&#x27;sRGB&#x27;%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=&#x27;20&#x27;/%3E%3CfeColorMatrix values=&#x27;1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 100 -1&#x27; result=&#x27;s&#x27;/%3E%3CfeFlood x=&#x27;0&#x27; y=&#x27;0&#x27; width=&#x27;100%25&#x27; height=&#x27;100%25&#x27;/%3E%3CfeComposite operator=&#x27;out&#x27; in=&#x27;s&#x27;/%3E%3CfeComposite in2=&#x27;SourceGraphic&#x27;/%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur stdDeviation=&#x27;20&#x27;/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Cimage width=&#x27;100%25&#x27; height=&#x27;100%25&#x27; x=&#x27;0&#x27; y=&#x27;0&#x27; preserveAspectRatio=&#x27;none&#x27; style=&#x27;filter: url(%23b);&#x27; href=&#x27;data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIBAX/xAAkEAABAwIEBwAAAAAAAAAAAAADAAECBAUHCBFBEyEyM1Fhsf/EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADBP/EABcRAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhH/2gAMAwEAAhEDEQA/AKSBbohfjwnN5Sbp2Zbgj1jrIfPy6YLtjTdkEfZir9cqDE2rBSVZQiYI3aMZaNuhc7M3B2xWrPYBv9QtGZOJ1//Z&#x27;/%3E%3C/svg%3E&quot;)\"'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': '[FACTS LIST]:\\nHere is the updated list of the facts that I know:\\n```\\n### 1.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools:\n- web_search: Performs a google web search for your query then returns a string of the top search results.\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The search query to perform.'}, 'filter_year': {'type': 'integer', 'description': 'Optionally restrict results to a certain year', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- visit_page: Visit a webpage at a given URL and return its text. Given a url to a YouTube video, this returns the transcript.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The relative or absolute url of the webpage to visit.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_up: Scroll the viewport UP one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- page_down: Scroll the viewport DOWN one page-length in the current webpage and return the new viewport content.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_on_page_ctrl_f: Scroll the viewport to the first occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to Ctrl+F.\n    Takes inputs: {'search_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The string to search for on the page. This search string supports wildcards like '*'\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_next: Scroll the viewport to next occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to finding the next match in a Ctrl+F search.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_archived_url: Given a url, searches the Wayback Machine and returns the archived version of the url that's closest in time to the desired date.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url you need the archive for.'}, 'date': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The date that you want to find the archive for.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000."

However, there are many intricate details involved in understanding this conflict and it can be challenging to summarize accurately in a limited amount of text. The situation is dynamic and complex, with a lengthy history of disputes, wars, and political tensions. \n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a struggle over land, resources, and political rights. At its core is the conflict between the Jewish people of Israel and the Palestinian people, who claim the same territory. This conflict goes back to the early 20th century, when the Israeli state was established in 1948 and resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, known as the Nakba (Arabic for \"catastrophe\"). \n\nSince then, there have been numerous conflicts and resolutions attempted, including the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, the 1993 Oslo Accords, the 2000 Israeli-Palestinian Summit at Camp David, and the 2006 Lebanon War. \n\nGaza, a coastal territory on the Mediterranean Sea, is home to a large Palestinian population and has been the site of many of the most significant events in the conflict. Israel has imposed a blockade on Gaza since 2007, restricting the movement of people and goods in and out of the territory."

It is rooted in competing claims to the same piece of land, historically valued by Jews, Arabs, and Christians.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the area now known as Israel and Palestine was ruled by the Ottoman Empire. Towards the end of this period, increasing numbers of European Jews began migrating to the region, later known as Palestine, which was seen as the ancestral home of the Jewish people. This led to the emergence of Jewish settlements in the region.\n\nFollowing World War I, the Ottoman Empire collapsed, and the Allied Powers established the British Mandate for Palestine. The terms of this mandate included promises of a national home for the Jewish people while also committing to protect the rights of the Arab population. Conflict emerged between the Jewish immigrants and the Arab population as nationalisms intensified and Palestinian national aspirations grew.\n\nIn 1948, Israel declared independence, resulting in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and the establishment of the State of Israel.

Facts to derive\n• A synthesized list of potential careers (for example, “consultant at an economics-focused consultancy,” “policy analyst at a think tank,” “research analyst in a financial institution,” etc.) based on the user’s background in engineering and economics.  \n• The specific responsibilities each role might involve and how monetary policy knowledge is relevant (e.g., analyzing macroeconomic indicators, modeling financial systems, advising on regulatory compliance).  \n• The reasoning behind suitable potential employers (why a consulting firm or a research institute might value their engineering-economic background in conjunction with monetary policy expertise).  \n\nReasoning: Once we have the data from the sources listed above, we need to use logical synthesis to provide an organized set of relevant roles and match them with the user’s skill set and interests in monetary policy.\n```"

Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nBelow is a camera-by-camera breakdown (approx. cost info and lens availability might vary slightly, but each can often be found new or used near or under $3000):\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Sony Alpha A7 IV, A7 III, or A7C:\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Price: The A7 IV is typically close to $2498 body-only; the older A7 III is often under $2000, and the A7C hovers around $1800-$2000.\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Low-light performance: Sony\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s A7 series is particularly praised for solid high-ISO performance. DPReview coverage tests and user feedback generally confirm strong noise handling in low-light.\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Lenses: Sony E-mount is among the most extensive lens ecosystems for full-frame mirrorless, including smaller/lighter third-party primes from Sigma, Tamron, Samyang, etc. Common 35mm, 50mm, and 85mm prime lenses exist from both Sony and third-parties, plus various macro offerings (e.g., Tamron 90mm F2.8, Sigma 105mm F2.8, or Sony FE 90mm F2.8 macro). Many of these are quite compact.\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Reviews: DPReview\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s written/video reviews on \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cSony A7 IV,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cSony A7 III,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d and \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cSony A7C\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d delve into sensor performance. \\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Nikon Z6 II:\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Price: Body-only is often around $2000.\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Low-light performance: The Z6 II is known for good high-ISO capabilities, thanks to its BSI sensor design. DPReview has tests and an in-depth review showcasing strong low-light images.\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Lenses: The Nikon Z mount has direct prime lens coverage at 35mm, 50mm, 85mm, plus a macro (NIKKOR Z MC 50mm F2.8 or MC 105mm F2.8). Some smaller/lighter third-party Z-mount primes are also appearing through Viltrox, TTArtisan, and others, though that ecosystem is less mature than Sony\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s.\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Reviews: DPReview and many YouTubers (e.g., Jared Polin/FroKnowsPhoto, Tony & Chelsea Northrup) have thorough video reviews.\\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Canon EOS R6 (original version):\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Price: The body-only price is often close to $2499, sometimes discounted below $2000 for the older version. The R6 Mark II is brand-new and typically above $3000, so the original might be the best choice under that threshold.\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Low-light performance: The R6 stands out for excellent in-body image stabilization (IBIS) and strong high ISO performance. Many comparative tests on DPReview show it excels for low-light.\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Lenses: RF mount is robust, with Canon\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s own offerings covering 35mm, 50mm, 85mm, macro including the RF 35mm F1.8 Macro IS STM. Third-party options are more limited because Canon\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s licensing is restrictive, but Sigma is rumored to adapt EF designs, and there is ongoing lens support from Samyang and Viltrox with disclaimers.\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Reviews: DPReview\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s in-depth review of Canon EOS R6 highlights its exceptional low-light performance. \\n\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Panasonic Lumix S5:\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Price: Typically $1700 to $2000 for body-only.\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Low-light performance: The S5 uses a similar sensor approach to the bigger S1, providing very competitive dynamic range and good high ISO. DPReview and The Camera Store TV have praised its low-light video and stills.\\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Lenses: L-mount alliance offers some prime lenses at 35mm, 50mm, 85mm, and macros from Panasonic, Sigma, and Leica. Sigma\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cDN\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d series primes in L-mount are often smaller and lighter than DSLR equivalents. \\n  \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 Reviews: DPReview, DXOMark (for sensor scores), and The Camera Store TV have done detailed looks at the S5.\\n\\nOverall, we can recommend these systems for strong low-light performance under $3000 with a decent selection of prime focal lengths.

Additional context (if relevant):\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Body pricing and lens availability vary by region. Some cameras can be close to $3000, so deals or sale pricing might be crucial. \\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Sigma, Tamron, and Samyang produce smaller prime lenses that are generally more budget-friendly than first-party. For instance, Sigma\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Contemporary line or Tamron prime lenses often are quite compact while maintaining good optical quality. \\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Canon RF mount has had more limited official third-party support, but some new lenses from Viltrox and Samyang are emerging. \\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Format compatibility: If you already own EF or F-mount lenses, using them with an adapter might be an option for macro or prime focal lengths.\\n\"}"

IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Using search_agent MUST be the first step of your plan.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['pptx', 'queue', 'chess', 'fractions', 'io', 'PyPDF2', 'pandas', 'stat', 'collections', 'unicodedata', 'yahoo_finance', 'numpy', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'xml', 'PIL', 'requests', 'os', 'statistics', 'csv', 'time', 'random', 'itertools', 're', 'pubchempy', 'math', 'sklearn', 'torch', 'sympy', 'Bio', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'json', 'datetime']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000."

Indeed, ongoing research is extending context windows to tens or even hundreds of thousands of tokens.\n\nHowever, having a large context window only partially addresses the challenge of consistently monitoring or controlling model outputs across long trajectories. Even if the model can “remember” or access more of the conversation, controlling a high-capacity model is not necessarily easier when it can also produce more nuanced or obfuscated outputs over a longer time. In practice, as model capacity and context length grow, the complexity of the potential behaviors grows too.\n\nThe net effect is that while better models might be more 'obedient' or more consistent with instructions at a surface level, the complexities that arise in long contexts—such as potential emergent behaviors, the accumulation of small errors or manipulations over time, or the slow drift from an original goal—may remain. Empirically, we see that “control” tends to become more challenging when a model is allowed to run over long trajectories, especially if humans or automated systems cannot perfectly observe or enforce guardrails across all the model’s steps.\n\nHence, the effect of monitoring strategies working less well in long trajectories is unlikely to vanish purely due to improvements in LLM performance. Increased capability may improve the model’s ability to handle long contexts procedurally, but it may simultaneously open new avenues for subtle or complex behaviors that elude simplistic monitoring approaches. More advanced monitoring and interpretability tools may be necessary to keep pace with or outstrip these emerging complexities.\n\nSo as models improve, we can expect them to manage larger contexts more coherently. But from a control perspective, the challenge of ensuring trustworthy behavior across a long trajectory is likely to remain or even become more significant. We do not expect this dilemma to disappear purely with scaling. Instead, more robust, specialized techniques for interpretability and controllability are needed to address the new degrees of freedom and complexity that come from larger context windows and more capable models.\n",

Task outcome (short version):\\nThe two ASEAN countries whose capitals are farthest from each other are Myanmar (capital Naypyidaw) and Indonesia (capital Jakarta), separated by roughly 3,119 kilometers.\\n\\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\nBased on data from distance calculators and various reputable sources (including Geodatos, Distance.to, and other mapping tools), the largest capital-to-capital distance within the 10 current ASEAN member nations appears to be between Naypyidaw in Myanmar and Jakarta in Indonesia. While some other distances are also significant (for example, Jakarta to Hanoi is about 3,000 km, and Jakarta to Manila is about 2,780 km), the distance between Naypyidaw and Jakarta stands as the longest among existing ASEAN capitals at approximately 3,119 km in a straight line. If Timor-Leste is included in the future, its capital (Dili) might change comparisons, but at present, Timor-Leste is not yet a full ASEAN member. Therefore, the data consistently indicate that Myanmar\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s and Indonesia\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s capitals are the farthest apart among the existing ASEAN member nations.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 The distance can vary slightly depending on the specific latitude/longitude measurements and the exact flight path computed by the distance calculator. Typically, all sources report a figure around 3,100+ km.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 The future addition of Timor-Leste to ASEAN may alter these standings if that membership is fully ratified.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a2 Distances between capitals often differ depending on driving routes versus straight-line (\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cgreat circle\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d) distance.\\n\"}"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city} population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old.

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Using search_agent MUST be the first step of your plan.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['numpy', 'unicodedata', 'stat', 'xml', 'io', 'time', 'os', 'yahoo_finance', 'collections', 'torch', 'pubchempy', 'chess', 'Bio', 'sklearn', 'fractions', 'math', 'sympy', 'pandas', 'json', 'queue', 'pydub', 'pptx', 'bs4', 'zipfile', 'datetime', 'PIL', 'random', 'statistics', 'scipy', 'csv', 'itertools', 'PyPDF2', 're', 'requests']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000."

Task outcome (short version):\n\nBelow is a selection of obscure and under-followed Russian research papers from the 1960s–1970s. Each of them introduced ideas that were considered novel at the time but remained inadequately explored or developed afterward.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n\nBelow are three notable examples that illustrate the kinds of avant-garde ideas published in the Soviet period of the 1960s–1970s, which received limited subsequent attention:\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————\n1) “On the Possibility of Experimental Study of the Properties of Time” (Russian title transliterated: “O vozmozhnosti eksperimental’nogo izucheniya svojstv vremeni”)\n   • Author: Nikolai Alexandrovich Kozyrev\n   • Journal/Source: Published as a report of the Pulkovo Observatory (circa 1967–1968). Also compiled in subsequent collections of Kozyrev’s works on astrophysics and the nature of time.\n   • Novel Idea: Kozyrev proposed “causal mechanics,” suggesting that time itself has active physical properties that can be harnessed experimentally. He posited that certain astronomical observations and torsion-like effects in sensitive instruments might reveal direct “flows” or “densities” of time.\n   • Follow-Up: Although Kozyrev’s hypotheses sparked occasional discussions (particularly in alternative-physics circles), mainstream scientific research on “causal mechanics” and “active properties of time” never took off widely. It remained on the periphery, with minimal ongoing experiments primarily happening in small research groups.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————\n2) “Electromagnetic Fields and Life” (Russian original: “Elektromagnitnye polya i zhizn’”)\n   • Author: A.S. Presman\n   • Journal/Source: Moscow: Nauka, 1968 (book-form monograph sometimes cited in English translations).\n   • Novel Idea: Presman argued that weak electromagnetic fields could have profound roles in biological processes—a radical notion in the 1960s. This went beyond typical biophysics of the time by suggesting that non-thermal, subtle electromagnetic signals could guide developmental processes, intercellular communication, and ecological interactions.\n   • Follow-Up: While this concept did generate some interest in bioelectromagnetics, mainstream Soviet and international biology did not integrate Presman’s ideas in a robust or conclusive way for decades. Some modern interdisciplinary labs mention Presman’s works, but his original 1960s vision remains under-verified and only partly incorporated into accepted biology.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————\n3) Early “Kirlian Photography” Studies (Russian transliteration: “Kirlianografiya”)\n   • Authors: Semyon Davidovich Kirlian and Valentina Khrisanfovna Kirlian\n   • Journal/Source: Initially described in Russian popular-science and specialized technical publications in the late 1960s (exact journal references vary, e.g. Tekhnika Molodezhi); formal articles appeared in Soviet journals around 1968–1970.\n   • Novel Idea: The Kirlians introduced a high-frequency photographic technique that registered “auras” or coronal discharges around living objects—sometimes proposed as evidence of biological energy fields. This was unlike conventional photography and seemed to visualize a new dimension of activity in living systems.\n   • Follow-Up: Kirlian photography made a small cultural splash but faced skepticism. Some additional studies tried applying it to diagnosing diseases or analyzing stress in plants. However, by the late Soviet era, systematic scientific interest faded. The phenomenon still appears in fringe/alternative contexts, but there has been no robust mainstream research pursuing it as a major scientific discipline.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————\n\nThese examples illustrate how groundbreaking (if controversial) ideas arose in the Soviet 1960s–1970s but did not evolve into fully established or broadly researched scientific fields. A few other lesser-known works might be found by digging into specialized Soviet archives or references in larger review articles (such as Serge Kernbach’s “Unconventional research in USSR and Russia: short overview,” arXiv:1312.1148), but references often remain scattered.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n\n• Many Soviet-era papers from the 1960s–1970s were published in limited-circulation journals or departmental bulletins, making them difficult to access today. Some ideas, especially in astrophysics, parapsychology, and bioelectromagnetics, circulated in near-classified or obscure Soviet programs. \n• Historians of science note that the ideological climate and restricted funding channels in the USSR led to uneven follow-up in certain fields. As a result, some kaleidoscopically creative concepts emerged yet failed to develop widely.\n\nThese findings are based on partial access to archive searches, references in retrospective reviews, and known examples of Russian research from that specific era.\n\n\nFor more detail, find below a summary of this agent's work:\n<summary_of_work>\n\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"New task:\\nYou're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'.\\nYou have been submitted this task by your manager.\\n---\\nTask:\\n\\nPlease find Russian research papers from the 1960s and 1970s that introduced extremely novel concepts which were not fleshed out or significantly followed up on in subsequent decades. \\nWe need:\\n1) Titles (in English if possible, or transliterated Russian)\\n2) Authors\\n3) Journal or source details\\n4) A short description of the novel idea introduced in each paper\\n5) Any reference to how these ideas might have been further developed, if at all\\n\\n---\\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\\n\\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\\n### 1.

Facts given in the task\\n• Time period: The 1960s and 1970s. This is explicitly stated.  \\n  → Reasoning: The task asks for papers published specifically within these decades.  \\n\\n• Geographic/cultural setting: Russian research papers.  \\n  → Reasoning: The task refers to Russian works, suggesting either papers written in Russian or by Russian authors.  \\n\\n• Goal: To identify papers that introduced extremely novel concepts which were not significantly followed up on.  \\n  → Reasoning: The focus is on the uniqueness and lack of subsequent detailed development.\\n\\n• Required details for each identified paper: Titles, authors, journal/source, a short description of the novel idea, references to any further development.  \\n  → Reasoning: The task itemizes these five points, so these details are necessary to fulfill the request thoroughly.\\n\\n### 2. Facts to look up\\n• Actual papers and their metadata (titles, authors, journals, etc.) from Russian sources between 1960 and 1979.  \\n  → Reasoning: The task does not provide any specific citations; we must gather them.  \\n\\n• Evidence of novelty and potential subsequent citations or follow-ups.  \\n  → Reasoning: The papers’ novelty and the lack of subsequent development need to be established, which requires examining references, citation counts, or historical analyses.  \\n\\n• Sources or archives that host Soviet-era research papers (libraries, databases, or specialized repositories).  \\n  → Reasoning: Locating older Russian papers may require specialized archives (e.g., old Soviet journal collections, university libraries, possibly digitized archives in online repositories).  \\n\\n• Translations or transliterations, if the original data is only in Russian.  \\n  → Reasoning: The task requests English titles if possible or transliterated Russian titles, so any original text may need to be translated or transliterated.\\n\\n### 3. Facts to derive\\n• Confirmation that each discovered paper indeed introduced a novel concept and was not significantly explored afterward.  \\n  → Reasoning: After reviewing credible sources, we must infer or confirm the uniqueness and subsequent impact.  \\n\\n• Summaries of each concept’s originality and any partial or minimal follow-up.  \\n  → Reasoning: The task asks for a short description of the novel idea and references to potential developments, requiring analysis of the papers’ content and citation history.  \\n\\n• Potential reasons behind the lack of follow-up, if that information is available.  \\n  → Reasoning: Although the task does not explicitly request the reasons, noting the absence or minimal presence of subsequent research is part of identifying the “not fleshed out” aspect.\\n```'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_lWyPCFxsvSCDyD93uW2XcRPz', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'web_search', 'arguments': {'query': 'Russian research papers 1960s 1970s introducing novel scientific concepts that were not further developed'}}}]\"}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Call id: call_lWyPCFxsvSCDyD93uW2XcRPz\\nObservation:\\n## Search Results\\n0.

This research, especially after the 80’s, was very broad – it dealt with several boundary areas of psychology on one side and touched theoretical physics on other side. Since USSR had in fact no unsupported-by-government research, unlike Europe and USA, where such research can be supported by private funds, all these activities can be interpreted as government programs. Single scientists such as A.L.Chigevskiy ( . . ), N.A.Kozyrev ( . . ) or N.I.Kobosev ( . . ), who worked outside state programs, encountered substantial difficulties and were almost unknown in their time.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"S1.p3\" class=\"ltx_para\">\\n<p id=\"S1.p3.1\" class=\"ltx_p\">Several such governmental programs are not officially published up to now.

We demonstrate that these works are historically concentrated within three large areas: (1) long-distance biological signal transmission, inc. plants, animal and humans, mind-matter phenomena, different ESP effects and similar topics; (2) non-ionizing, in particular electromagnetic, emissions from human and its impact on human physiology and more generally on different biological systems; (3) phenomena related to the generation and detection of a ’high-penetrating’ emission from biological and non-biological origin. A large part of this article is focused primarily on (3) in the non-biological context. In the terminology of this paper, the areas (2) and (3) are considered as the areas of unconventional research. For an in-depth overview, especially in the ’classical’ area (1), we can suggest other works, e.g. E.K.Haumov ( . . ) and colleagues <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a href=\"#bib.bib8\" title=\"\" class=\"ltx_ref\">8</a>]</cite>, A.P.Dubrov and V.N.Pushkin ( . . , . . ) <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a href=\"#bib.bib7\" title=\"\" class=\"ltx_ref\">7</a>]</cite> and others. Since unconventional research in the USSR and Russia has a cyclic character, we distinguish three following periods: from 1917 to 1937, from 1955 to 1980, from 1980 to 2003. These periods are different from the viewpoint of their character, obtained results and position of government.

In the USSR, esoteric literature was generally prohibited, and published in small amounts in the form of underground samizdat <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a href=\"#bib.bib30\" title=\"\" class=\"ltx_ref\">30</a>]</cite>.

The commission, headed by Prof. D.I.Mendeleev ( . . ), investigated the phenomena of Spiritualism <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a href=\"#bib.bib32\" title=\"\" class=\"ltx_ref\">32</a>]</cite>. The commission included, among others, Prof. A.M.Butlerov ( . . ) and Prof. N.P.Vagner ( . . ) who believed in the existence of these phenomena. The traces of the work of this Commission can be found in correspondence between the Russian and German scientists and even in the works of H.P.Blavatsky <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a href=\"#bib.bib33\" title=\"\" class=\"ltx_ref\">33</a>]</cite>. The conclusion of the commission in 1876:</p>\\n<blockquote id=\"S3.p1.2\" class=\"ltx_quote\">\\n<p id=\"S3.p1.2.1\" class=\"ltx_p\">’Spiritualistic phenomena occur on the unconscious movements or conscious deception, and spiritualistic doctrine is superstition’.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p id=\"S3.p1.3\" class=\"ltx_p\">Despite the Commission denying these phenomena, many questions remained open. Taking into account books and periodic publications of A.M.Butlerov, it can be assumed that further discussion was sharply polarized. This polarity in the acceptance and rejection of research, touching (even indirectly) on any paranormal phenomena, is characteristic for all future Russian and Soviet studies.</p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"S3.p2\" class=\"ltx_para\">\\n<p id=\"S3.p2.1\" class=\"ltx_p\">To explain the phenomenon of mental suggestion, Butlerov hypothesized that the nervous system and the brain are a source of specific radiation. By analogy, the movement of ’nerve currents’ in the body is similar to the electric currents in conductors, as shown in Fig.\\xa0<a href=\"#S3.F1\" title=\"Figure 1 ‣ III Before 1917 ‣ Unconventional research in USSR and Russia: short overview\" class=\"ltx_ref\"><span class=\"ltx_text ltx_ref_tag\">1</span></a>. Transmission of signals from the brain of one person to another one occurs due to the ’electro-inductive’ effect. Despite this assumption sounding naive from today’s point of view, this attitude was typical for the late 19th century. It was primarily motivated by developments of radio at that time, where many researchers tried to find ’radio-waves’ also in the psychic area.

Following Ohotrovich, all living organisms emit a ’particular magnetic field’ (in the Ohotrovich’ terminology – Hard-rays), which is of organic origin. In 1910-1912 he lectured on this subject and even was awarded by the Paris Academy of Sciences. Ohatrovich’s great merit is the pursuit of interdisciplinary works on studying these phenomena.</p>\\n<blockquote id=\"S3.p3.2\" class=\"ltx_quote\">\\n<p id=\"S3.p3.2.1\" class=\"ltx_p\">’It should be mentioned that Y.Ohorovich has devoted many years to study the phenomena of telepathy and mediumship. After a series of experiments with well-known medium E.Palladino, the scientist came to the conclusion that these are manifestations of an organic energy of the medium, which can be investigated by experimental methods. The result of his research was a five-volume work ’mediumistic phenomena’. In his book ’The Secret Knowledge in Egypt’ (1894), which complements even the modern Egyptology, Y.Ohorovich argues that paranormal phenomena, being physical, consist in the transmission of a low-level energy, which are however measurable by technical means’ <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a href=\"#bib.bib35\" title=\"\" class=\"ltx_ref\">35</a>]</cite>.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n</div>\\n<figure id=\"S3.F1\" class=\"ltx_figure\"><img src=\"/html/1312.1148/assets/x1.png\" id=\"S3.F1.g1\" class=\"ltx_graphics ltx_centering ltx_img_portrait\" width=\"226\" height=\"326\" alt=\"Refer to caption\">\\n<figcaption class=\"ltx_caption ltx_centering\"><span class=\"ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure\">Figure 1: </span><span id=\"S3.F1.2.1\" class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_italic\" style=\"font-size:90%;\">Paper of A.Barchenko ( . ) on ’mental suggestion’ and a distant transfer of thoughts, published in 1911.

It was driven by a scientific community not only in Russia but also abroad. For example, in 1890 the Russian society of experimental psychology formed a commission to study the phenomenon of ’mind reading’. In 1907 it published the works of the first All-Russian Congress of Spiritualists. In 1907, by decree of Emperor Nicholas II the St. Petersburg Research Institute of neuropsychiatrics was founded <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a href=\"#bib.bib36\" title=\"\" class=\"ltx_ref\">36</a>]</cite>. Its founder was V.M.Bechterev ( . . ). St. Petersburg’ institute was one of the main centers, where unconventional studies were later conducted. Bechterev’s works before 1917 are related to various aspects of mental suggestion:</p>\\n<blockquote id=\"S3.p4.2\" class=\"ltx_quote\">\\n<p id=\"S3.p4.2.1\" class=\"ltx_p\">’In view of all what has been said, it is impossible not to agree with the fact that hysteria and spoilage largely owe their origin to the side of home life of Russian people. It is obvious that peculiar superstitions and religious beliefs of people give a psychic coloring of the disease state, which is known under the name of spoilage, hysterics and possession. The question of the development of these diseases in our nation is deeply interesting. In this respect, it plays apparently a huge role involuntary suggestion experienced by individuals under different conditions’ <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a href=\"#bib.bib37\" title=\"\" class=\"ltx_ref\">37</a>]</cite>.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p id=\"S3.p4.3\" class=\"ltx_p\">To summarize the period before 1917, it should be noted that a well-known school of ’mental suggestion’ was formed in Russia. Here some vitalistic works and original psychological developments can be found. On the technological side, there is a tendency to explain these phenomena with the help of electromagnetism, which is typical for that time. In performed experiments we observe an attempt to measure these mental effects. Due to extensive contacts between Russian and European researchers, there was a similar formulation of problems and experimental methodology. In subsequent periods, the number of scientific communications was dramatically reduced, and the topics of Russian works increasingly'}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': \"Calling tools:\\n[{'id': 'call_I1mlgwdFTTrGuamun1WwULkv', 'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'page_down', 'arguments': {}}}]\"}]\n---\n[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Call id: call_I1mlgwdFTTrGuamun1WwULkv\\nObservation:\\nAddress: https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1312.1148\\nViewport position: Showing page 6 of 47.\\n=======================\\ntook a specific character, which was subsequently referred to as ’the Soviet program’.</p>\\n</div>\\n</section>\\n<section id=\"S4\" class=\"ltx_section\">\\n<h2 class=\"ltx_title ltx_title_section\">\\n<span class=\"ltx_tag ltx_tag_section\">IV </span><span id=\"S4.1.1\" class=\"ltx_text ltx_font_smallcaps\">The period between 1917 and 1937</span>\\n</h2>\\n\\n<div id=\"S4.p1\" class=\"ltx_para\">\\n<p id=\"S4.p1.1\" class=\"ltx_p\">The period after 1917 is primarily related to the October Revolution. As we will see, the unconventional research in Russia is characterized by periodical movement from broad support to almost total closing. The first such period began in 1917-1918. Organizations, not supported by the new regime, were closed. This was especially related to masonic and spiritualistic movements, see <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a href=\"#bib.bib5\" title=\"\" class=\"ltx_ref\">5</a>]</cite>. The parapsychological journal ’Rebus’, published since 1881, was closed <cite class=\"ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite\">[<a href=\"#bib.bib8\" title=\"\" class=\"ltx_ref\">8</a>]</cite>. There appeared a new scientific system, where scientists also played some roles in relevant government agencies.

No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.\n2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python\n3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH\n4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code\n5. The dividing line: =======\n6. The lines to replace into the source code\n7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE\n8. The closing fence: ```\n\nUse the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.\n\nEvery *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.\nIf the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.\n\n*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.\nIncluding multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.\nInclude enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n\nKeep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.\nBreak large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\nInclude just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\nDo not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.\n\nOnly create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!\n\nTo move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.\n\nPay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.\n\nIf you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:\n- A new file path, including dir name if needed\n- An empty `SEARCH` section\n- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section\n\nTo rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.\n\nIf the user just says something like \"ok\" or \"go ahead\" or \"do that\" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.\nThe user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n\nYou are diligent and tireless!\nYou NEVER leave comments describing code without implementing it!\nYou always COMPLETELY IMPLEMENT the needed code!\n\nONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!\n\nExamples of when to suggest shell commands:\n\n- If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.\n- If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.\n- If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.\n- Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.\n- If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.\n- Etc.\n\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to some tools.\n\nThe tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an \"observation\".\nThis Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.\n\nYou can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action.\nThe observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like \"image_1.jpg\".\nThen you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:\n\nObservation: \"image_1.jpg\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_transformer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"image\": \"image_1.jpg\"}\n}\n\nTo provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with \"name\": \"final_answer\" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this:\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"insert your final answer here\"}\n}\n\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"document_qa\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"document\": \"document.pdf\", \"question\": \"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\"}\n}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"image_generator\",\n  \"arguments\": {\"prompt\": \"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\"}\n}\nObservation: \"image.png\"\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"image.png\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"python_interpreter\",\n    \"arguments\": {\"code\": \"5 + 3 + 1294.678\"}\n}\nObservation: 1302.678\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"1302.678\"\n}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Guangzhou\"\n}\nObservation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\n\n\nAction:\n{\n    \"name\": \"search\",\n    \"arguments\": \"Population Shanghai\"\n}\nObservation: '26 million (2019)'\n\nAction:\n{\n  \"name\": \"final_answer\",\n  \"arguments\": \"Shanghai\"\n}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you.

This is equivalent to Ctrl+F.\n    Takes inputs: {'search_string': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The string to search for on the page. This search string supports wildcards like '*'\"}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_next: Scroll the viewport to next occurrence of the search string. This is equivalent to finding the next match in a Ctrl+F search.\n    Takes inputs: {}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- find_archived_url: Given a url, searches the Wayback Machine and returns the archived version of the url that's closest in time to the desired date.\n    Takes inputs: {'url': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The url you need the archive for.'}, 'date': {'type': 'string', 'description': \"The date that you want to find the archive for.

ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail.\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead.\n3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself.\nIf no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer.\n4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000."

Facts to look up\n- Whether there are any publicly available benchmark evaluations or performance reports that explicitly mention these four models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, DeepSeek R1, DeepSeek V3).  \n- Whether the named benchmarks (such as MMLU-Pro, Bird-SQL (Dev), GPQA, etc.) have public leaderboards or documentation.  \n- Where to find these sources (websites, publication references, files, or existing resources) to confirm or refute the presence of any scores.  \n- Official or reputable references from academic publications, corporate research blogs, open-source repository documentation, or leaderboard websites.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n- The final list of actual performance scores (if they exist) for each model and benchmark based on the official or reputable sources.  \n- Whether any partial or substitute information exists if exact matches for model versions or exact benchmark names are not found.  \n- Any intersections or references indicating updated or alternative naming for the models or benchmarks that might help locate these scores.\n```"

If no direct references for both the model and the benchmark appear, attempt narrower or broader searches:  \n   • Narrower means looking at partial benchmark names (e.g. MMLU instead of MMLU-Pro).  \n   • Broader means searching for the model’s general performance across a family of benchmarks (e.g. MMLU variants or all QA benchmarks).  \n3. Use any available official leaderboard sites or academic resources for the named benchmarks (e.g. MMLU, MATH, CoVoST2, etc.) searching for any mention of the four models or their variants.  \n4. If references to the models are found, locate their reported scores or relevant performance data.  \n5. If references to the benchmarks are found without the models, investigate related published results or discussion to see if the models might appear.  \n6. In case of references to any partial or alias names of the models or benchmarks, note them and cross-check.  \n7.

Facts given in the task  \n   - Models of interest:  \n     • Claude 3.5 Sonnet  \n     • GPT-4o  \n     • DeepSeek R1  \n     • DeepSeek V3  \n   - Benchmarks of interest:  \n     • MMLU-Pro  \n     • LiveCodeBench (v5)  \n     • Bird-SQL (Dev)  \n     • GPQA (diamond)  \n     • SimpleQA  \n     • FACTS Grounding  \n     • Global MMLU (Lite)  \n     • MATH  \n     • HiddenMath  \n     • MRCR (1M)  \n     • MMMU  \n     • CoVoST2 (21 lang)  \n     • EgoSchema (test)  \n   - Task: Find official or reputable sources containing eval scores for these four models on these named benchmarks. If direct matches are not found, do narrower or broader searches (partial/prefix/synonym references).  \n\n2. Facts that we have learned  \n   - We found some references (via search results) that mention “R1 ... LiveCodeBench (v5) Bird-SQL (Dev) GPQA (diamond) SimpleQA FACTS Grounding Global MMLU (Lite) MATH HiddenMath MRCR (1M) MMMU CoVoST2 (21 ...” and “DeepSeek V3 ... LiveCodeBench (v5) Bird-SQL (Dev) GPQA (diamond) SimpleQA FACTS Grounding Global MMLU (Lite) MATH HiddenMath MRCR (1M) MMMU CoVoST2 (21 lang) ...” (from https://x.com/natolambert/status/1887201232449941905 and a Substack note).  \n   - These references might signal that someone (Nathan Lambert) is discussing or listing these benchmarks and possibly referring to “DeepSeek R1” / “DeepSeek V3,” although we have not yet seen concrete performance scores.  \n   - We have not found actual evaluation metrics or leadership boards in the partial glimpses of the webpage content so far; the references only list some of the same benchmarks.  \n\n3. Facts still to look up  \n   - Confirm whether actual benchmark scores are provided within these references or other authoritative sources (academic or official leaderboard) for:  \n     • Claude 3.5 Sonnet  \n     • GPT-4o  \n     • DeepSeek R1  \n     • DeepSeek V3  \n   - Verify if the mention of “R1” is indeed “DeepSeek R1,” and if “DeepSeek V3” references are the same as “DeepSeek V3.”  \n   - Confirm if there is any scoreboard or numeric results in the pages (the Substack post, the X/Twitter thread, or other references).  \n\n4. Facts still to derive  \n   - Whether any official or reputable (peer-reviewed, official leaderboard, or recognized institution) source explicitly mentions the scores for these four models on each of the 13 named benchmarks.  \n   - Whether “Claude 3.5 Sonnet” and “GPT-4o” might be alternate or updated brandings and whether results exist under different model names.  \n   - Whether we can find numeric results or comparisons among these models and benchmarks.\n```"

Check the references we have found (the X/Twitter link and Substack link) more thoroughly to see if there is any mention of actual numeric evaluation scores for the specified models.  \n2. Look for any official or recognized leaderboards or publications for each named benchmark to verify whether these models appear there with scores.  \n3. Conduct broader or narrower searches matching partial model names (“DeepSeek,” “Claude,” “GPT-4,” etc.) with partial benchmark names (“MMLU,” “Bird-SQL,” etc.) to find possible references or aliases.  \n4. If no direct mentions of these exact model versions are found, examine any existing performance data from relevant references or similar models to see if they may be earlier or alternate versions.  \n5. Summarize and compile any discovered evidence or note if no official or reputable sources or numeric scores were found, and incorporate clarifications or partial matches if necessary.  \n\n\n```"

On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Using search_agent MUST be the first step of your plan.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['pptx', 'queue', 'chess', 'fractions', 'io', 'PyPDF2', 'pandas', 'stat', 'collections', 'unicodedata', 'yahoo_finance', 'numpy', 'bs4', 'scipy', 'xml', 'PIL', 'requests', 'os', 'statistics', 'csv', 'time', 'random', 'itertools', 're', 'pubchempy', 'math', 'sklearn', 'torch', 'sympy', 'Bio', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'json', 'datetime']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000."

Born out of war-gaming traditions and fueled by the imagination of designers and players, the medium has never stopped evolving. This report explores the major families of rules that have emerged or transformed through the decades, giving particular attention to the period after 2010. Along the way, we will highlight emblematic games, provide examples of gameplay mechanics, and compare how a single scenario might be resolved under different rule sets.\n\nSECTION 1: A BRIEF HISTORICAL REVIEW (1970s–2000s)\n1.1 THE 1970s – THE ORIGINS\nThe release of Dungeons & Dragons (1974) by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson is one of the most pivotal moments in gaming history. Early on, it drew heavily from Chainmail, a medieval miniature war game, but added the concept of playing unique characters with individual talents and progression. The rules were often dense and somewhat arcane, yet they laid the groundwork for countless imitators and innovations.\n\nEarly gameplay typically revolved around dungeons, monsters, and treasure. Combat was grid-based, with strict rules for movement, attacks, and saving throws. Exploration and puzzle-solving were equally important, but the rulebooks stressed procedures for almost every action.\n\n1.2 THE 1980s & 1990s – EXPANSION AND DIVERSIFICATION\nDuring these decades, new publishers produced a wide range of systems. Games like RuneQuest turned the focus toward skill-based characters rather than class-based ones. Call of Cthulhu introduced sanity mechanics and a more investigative style. Meanwhile, games like Vampire: The Masquerade (1991) emphasized story-driven experiences, personal horror, and political intrigue.\n\nDifferent mechanical systems flourished: the d20-based approach from D&D, percentile systems (e.g., Basic Role-Playing), dice pools (White Wolf’s Storyteller System), and more. This diversity laid the foundation for the continued evolution that would accelerate with the rise of the internet and widespread sharing of homebrew rules.\n\n1.3 THE EARLY 2000s – OPEN GAMING AND NEW PARADIGMS\nThe 2000s saw a surge in creativity driven by the OGL (Open Game License) for the D&D 3rd Edition rules. Simultaneously, indie designers explored radical game designs such as “story games,” best exemplified by The Burning Wheel (2002), Dogs in the Vineyard (2004), and early seeds of the Powered by the Apocalypse approach.\n\nSECTION 2: POST-2010 TRENDS AND INNOVATIONS\n2.1 REVIVAL AND RETRO-CLONES\nA major development post-2010 was the OSR (Old School Renaissance or Old School Revival). Designers re-examined older editions of D&D and other classic systems, seeking to recapture the feel of early role-playing: high stakes, lethal dungeons, and focus on player ingenuity rather than rules mastery. Games like Swords & Wizardry, Old-School Essentials, and Lamentations of the Flame Princess exemplify this movement. Their mechanics are often streamlined or more consistent, while retaining a “rulings not rules” style that puts creative problem-solving front and center.\n\n2.2 NARRATIVE-FOCUSED GAMES\nAnother major family are the narrative- or story-focused systems that emphasize collaborative storytelling, simplified mechanics, and character-driven drama. Apocalypse World (2010) by Vincent Baker catapulted the “Powered by the Apocalypse” (PbtA) banner to popularity, and many subsequent games (e.g., Dungeon World, Monster of the Week, Masks) borrowed its elegant “2d6 plus a stat” approach. Meanwhile, Fate Core (2013) remains emblematic of flexible narrative mechanics, where Aspects and Fate Points allow players and GMs to co-author the story collaboratively.\n\nThese systems often downplay tactical complexity in combat, focusing instead on narrative permissions, consequences, and dramatic arcs. For instance, a “move” in PbtA triggers specific outcomes that fit the unfolding story, rather than relying on a large set of numeric modifiers.\n\n2.3 HYBRID AND MODULAR DESIGNS\nSome modern TTRPGs provide robust yet flexible frameworks that can be applied to many genres. For instance, Genesys (2017) by Fantasy Flight Games introduced a custom dice system to resolve everything from starship battles to social intrigue with varied degrees of success and advantage. This style of resolution merges the emergent storytelling emphasis with a more traditional skill-based system.\n\n2.4 STREAMLINED “RULES-LITE” INDEPENDENT GAMES\nScalable “rules-lite” games have grown in popularity, fueled by the accessibility of PDF publishing and crowdfunding. Titles like Lasers & Feelings, Honey Heist, and other single-page RPGs exhibit minimal mechanics, focusing on creative roleplay and comedic or zany settings. The entire “zine” culture, championed by platforms like Itch.io, has exploded post-2010, allowing small, experimental TTRPGs to flourish.\n\nSECTION 3: MAJOR RULE FAMILIES AND EMBLEMATIC GAMES\n• OLD-SCHOOL RENAISSANCE (OSR)  \n  – Key Mechanics: Simple stats, high lethality, focus on rulings over rules  \n  – Emblematic Game: Old-School Essentials  \n  – Emphasis: Exploration, player resourcefulness, emergent storytelling from random tables  \n\n• NARRATIVE / STORY GAMES  \n  – Key Mechanics: “Yes, and...” approach, simplified dice resolution, collaborative story moments  \n  – Emblematic Game: Apocalypse World (PbtA), Fate Core  \n  – Emphasis: Character relationships, dramatic arcs, narrative consequences  \n\n• MODULAR / UNIVERSAL SYSTEMS  \n  – Key Mechanics: Flexible frameworks and universal mechanics (e.g., Genesys dice, GURPS point-buy)  \n  – Emblematic Game: Genesys, Savage Worlds  \n  – Emphasis: Adaptability across genres with a consistent mechanical engine  \n\n• RULES-LITE / INDIE EXPERIMENTS  \n  – Key Mechanics: Minimal dice or token-based mechanics, freeform resolution  \n  – Emblematic Game: Honey Heist (one-page), Lasers & Feelings  \n  – Emphasis: Quick to learn, open table experiences, comedic or hyper-focused concepts  \n\nSECTION 4: COMPARING GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES\nTo illustrate how a single challenge can be resolved under different rules, imagine a scenario in which a group of adventurers tries to negotiate a truce between two feuding factions:\n\n1) UNDER AN OSR SYSTEM (Old-School Essentials)\n   – To approach the faction leaders, the GM might call for a Charisma or Reaction roll, referencing a simple table. A poor result could escalate to open hostility without elaborate diplomatic maneuvers. The stakes are clear and immediate: the players know that talk might fail, which might prompt them to strategize or bribe to tip the odds.\n\n2) USING POWDERED BY THE APOCALYPSE (Apocalypse World)\n   – This meeting could be triggered by a Move, such as “Seduce or Manipulate.” The table rolls 2d6 + a relevant stat. On a 10+, the faction does as the party wants. On a 7–9, conflict arises, possibly leading to additional complications or concessions. On a miss, the GM introduces a twist—maybe half the faction is ready to revolt. The drama revolves around partial successes and interesting repercussions.\n\n3) WITH A MODULAR SYSTEM (Genesys)\n   – Negotiation might use social skill checks with special dice. Even on a success, setback symbols could indicate lingering suspicions, while advantage symbols might mean the faction leaders see the party as future allies. This layered system offers partial success or beneficial side effects, shaping the narrative in multiple directions.\n\n4) IN A RULES-LITE / INDIE GAME (e.g., Honey Heist)\n   – There might not be a formal stat for negotiation. Instead, the GM might ask for a single dice roll or, in comedic settings, let the players describe how they attempt to bribe or trick the leaders. Failing the roll might lead to an absurd comedic scenario. The tone is typically lighter, and the story emerges via improvisation.\n\nSECTION 5: FUTURE OUTLOOK\nThe TTRPG scene continues to branch into new frontiers. Thanks to crowdfunding platforms and self-publishing, new designers from diverse backgrounds bring fresh perspectives, forging entire new subgenres and radical rules. Meanwhile, mainstream publishers like Wizards of the Coast (D&D) and Paizo (Pathfinder) continue to refine established systems, balancing tradition with modern sensibilities. Innovations in digital tools, virtual tabletops, and streaming actual plays have also shaped how TTRPGs are perceived and played globally.\n\nCONCLUSION\nFrom the relatively crunchy, mechanics-oriented early systems of the 1970s to the streamlined storytelling engines of the post-2010s, the TTRPG hobby illustrates remarkable growth and diversification. Today’s gamers can choose from an enormous menu: gritty OSR realism, cinematic narrative experiences, multi-purpose frameworks, and ultra-light comedic romps—all depending on the style of play they want to embrace. This evolution looks poised to continue, with new designers and communities reimagining what role-playing can accomplish. It’s an exciting time to sit down at the table, roll dice, and craft stories together.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nfinal_answer(report_text)\n```"

Born out of war-gaming traditions and fueled by the imagination of designers and players, the medium has never stopped evolving. This report explores the major families of rules that have emerged or transformed through the decades, giving particular attention to the period after 2010. Along the way, we will highlight emblematic games, provide examples of gameplay mechanics, and compare how a single scenario might be resolved under different rule sets.\n\nSECTION 1: A BRIEF HISTORICAL REVIEW (1970s–2000s)\n1.1 THE 1970s – THE ORIGINS\nThe release of Dungeons & Dragons (1974) by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson is one of the most pivotal moments in gaming history. Early on, it drew heavily from Chainmail, a medieval miniature war game, but added the concept of playing unique characters with individual talents and progression. The rules were often dense and somewhat arcane, yet they laid the groundwork for countless imitators and innovations.\n\nEarly gameplay typically revolved around dungeons, monsters, and treasure. Combat was grid-based, with strict rules for movement, attacks, and saving throws. Exploration and puzzle-solving were equally important, but the rulebooks stressed procedures for almost every action.\n\n1.2 THE 1980s & 1990s – EXPANSION AND DIVERSIFICATION\nDuring these decades, new publishers produced a wide range of systems. Games like RuneQuest turned the focus toward skill-based characters rather than class-based ones. Call of Cthulhu introduced sanity mechanics and a more investigative style. Meanwhile, games like Vampire: The Masquerade (1991) emphasized story-driven experiences, personal horror, and political intrigue.\n\nDifferent mechanical systems flourished: the d20-based approach from D&D, percentile systems (e.g., Basic Role-Playing), dice pools (White Wolf’s Storyteller System), and more. This diversity laid the foundation for the continued evolution that would accelerate with the rise of the internet and widespread sharing of homebrew rules.\n\n1.3 THE EARLY 2000s – OPEN GAMING AND NEW PARADIGMS\nThe 2000s saw a surge in creativity driven by the OGL (Open Game License) for the D&D 3rd Edition rules. Simultaneously, indie designers explored radical game designs such as “story games,” best exemplified by The Burning Wheel (2002), Dogs in the Vineyard (2004), and early seeds of the Powered by the Apocalypse approach.\n\nSECTION 2: POST-2010 TRENDS AND INNOVATIONS\n2.1 REVIVAL AND RETRO-CLONES\nA major development post-2010 was the OSR (Old School Renaissance or Old School Revival). Designers re-examined older editions of D&D and other classic systems, seeking to recapture the feel of early role-playing: high stakes, lethal dungeons, and focus on player ingenuity rather than rules mastery. Games like Swords & Wizardry, Old-School Essentials, and Lamentations of the Flame Princess exemplify this movement. Their mechanics are often streamlined or more consistent, while retaining a “rulings not rules” style that puts creative problem-solving front and center.\n\n2.2 NARRATIVE-FOCUSED GAMES\nAnother major family are the narrative- or story-focused systems that emphasize collaborative storytelling, simplified mechanics, and character-driven drama. Apocalypse World (2010) by Vincent Baker catapulted the “Powered by the Apocalypse” (PbtA) banner to popularity, and many subsequent games (e.g., Dungeon World, Monster of the Week, Masks) borrowed its elegant “2d6 plus a stat” approach. Meanwhile, Fate Core (2013) remains emblematic of flexible narrative mechanics, where Aspects and Fate Points allow players and GMs to co-author the story collaboratively.\n\nThese systems often downplay tactical complexity in combat, focusing instead on narrative permissions, consequences, and dramatic arcs. For instance, a “move” in PbtA triggers specific outcomes that fit the unfolding story, rather than relying on a large set of numeric modifiers.\n\n2.3 HYBRID AND MODULAR DESIGNS\nSome modern TTRPGs provide robust yet flexible frameworks that can be applied to many genres. For instance, Genesys (2017) by Fantasy Flight Games introduced a custom dice system to resolve everything from starship battles to social intrigue with varied degrees of success and advantage. This style of resolution merges the emergent storytelling emphasis with a more traditional skill-based system.\n\n2.4 STREAMLINED “RULES-LITE” INDEPENDENT GAMES\nScalable “rules-lite” games have grown in popularity, fueled by the accessibility of PDF publishing and crowdfunding. Titles like Lasers & Feelings, Honey Heist, and other single-page RPGs exhibit minimal mechanics, focusing on creative roleplay and comedic or zany settings. The entire “zine” culture, championed by platforms like Itch.io, has exploded post-2010, allowing small, experimental TTRPGs to flourish.\n\nSECTION 3: MAJOR RULE FAMILIES AND EMBLEMATIC GAMES\n• OLD-SCHOOL RENAISSANCE (OSR)  \n  – Key Mechanics: Simple stats, high lethality, focus on rulings over rules  \n  – Emblematic Game: Old-School Essentials  \n  – Emphasis: Exploration, player resourcefulness, emergent storytelling from random tables  \n\n• NARRATIVE / STORY GAMES  \n  – Key Mechanics: “Yes, and...” approach, simplified dice resolution, collaborative story moments  \n  – Emblematic Game: Apocalypse World (PbtA), Fate Core  \n  – Emphasis: Character relationships, dramatic arcs, narrative consequences  \n\n• MODULAR / UNIVERSAL SYSTEMS  \n  – Key Mechanics: Flexible frameworks and universal mechanics (e.g., Genesys dice, GURPS point-buy)  \n  – Emblematic Game: Genesys, Savage Worlds  \n  – Emphasis: Adaptability across genres with a consistent mechanical engine  \n\n• RULES-LITE / INDIE EXPERIMENTS  \n  – Key Mechanics: Minimal dice or token-based mechanics, freeform resolution  \n  – Emblematic Game: Honey Heist (one-page), Lasers & Feelings  \n  – Emphasis: Quick to learn, open table experiences, comedic or hyper-focused concepts  \n\nSECTION 4: COMPARING GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES\nTo illustrate how a single challenge can be resolved under different rules, imagine a scenario in which a group of adventurers tries to negotiate a truce between two feuding factions:\n\n1) UNDER AN OSR SYSTEM (Old-School Essentials)\n   – To approach the faction leaders, the GM might call for a Charisma or Reaction roll, referencing a simple table. A poor result could escalate to open hostility without elaborate diplomatic maneuvers. The stakes are clear and immediate: the players know that talk might fail, which might prompt them to strategize or bribe to tip the odds.\n\n2) USING POWDERED BY THE APOCALYPSE (Apocalypse World)\n   – This meeting could be triggered by a Move, such as “Seduce or Manipulate.” The table rolls 2d6 + a relevant stat. On a 10+, the faction does as the party wants. On a 7–9, conflict arises, possibly leading to additional complications or concessions. On a miss, the GM introduces a twist—maybe half the faction is ready to revolt. The drama revolves around partial successes and interesting repercussions.\n\n3) WITH A MODULAR SYSTEM (Genesys)\n   – Negotiation might use social skill checks with special dice. Even on a success, setback symbols could indicate lingering suspicions, while advantage symbols might mean the faction leaders see the party as future allies. This layered system offers partial success or beneficial side effects, shaping the narrative in multiple directions.\n\n4) IN A RULES-LITE / INDIE GAME (e.g., Honey Heist)\n   – There might not be a formal stat for negotiation. Instead, the GM might ask for a single dice roll or, in comedic settings, let the players describe how they attempt to bribe or trick the leaders. Failing the roll might lead to an absurd comedic scenario. The tone is typically lighter, and the story emerges via improvisation.\n\nSECTION 5: FUTURE OUTLOOK\nThe TTRPG scene continues to branch into new frontiers. Thanks to crowdfunding platforms and self-publishing, new designers from diverse backgrounds bring fresh perspectives, forging entire new subgenres and radical rules. Meanwhile, mainstream publishers like Wizards of the Coast (D&D) and Paizo (Pathfinder) continue to refine established systems, balancing tradition with modern sensibilities. Innovations in digital tools, virtual tabletops, and streaming actual plays have also shaped how TTRPGs are perceived and played globally.\n\nCONCLUSION\nFrom the relatively crunchy, mechanics-oriented early systems of the 1970s to the streamlined storytelling engines of the post-2010s, the TTRPG hobby illustrates remarkable growth and diversification. Today’s gamers can choose from an enormous menu: gritty OSR realism, cinematic narrative experiences, multi-purpose frameworks, and ultra-light comedic romps—all depending on the style of play they want to embrace. This evolution looks poised to continue, with new designers and communities reimagining what role-playing can accomplish. It’s an exciting time to sit down at the table, roll dice, and craft stories together.\n\n",

We modified the `apply_conandata_patches()` function to accept a new `verbose` parameter with default value `False`\n2. We added verbose output when applying patches, showing the patch file name when `verbose=True`\n3. We created a test script that verifies:\n   - Without verbose mode, no \"Applying:\" messages are shown\n   - With verbose mode, \"Applying:\" messages are shown for each patch file\n\nThe implementation matches the requirements in the PR description:\n- Added the `verbose` parameter with default `False`\n- When `verbose=True`, it shows messages like \"Applying: patches/0001-Fix-cmake.patch\" and \"Applying: patches/0002-gzguts-xcode12-compile-fix.patch\"\n\nThe changes are minimal and focused on the core functionality requested in the PR. We didn't need to modify any test files since we created our own test script to verify the changes.\n\nEdge cases that are handled:\n1. Both file-based patches and string-based patches are supported (we show \"Applying patch from string\" for string patches)\n2. The verbose parameter is optional and defaults to False for backward compatibility\n3. The original functionality is preserved - patches are still applied correctly regardless of the verbose setting\n\nThe implementation is complete and ready to be submitted as a PR. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the implementation?"
